## salt-study

This application is a simple SPA for my company, previously it was built with bootstrap and jquery.
I rebuilt it for them, bootstrapping with create-react-app. This application is built with the primary
packages being react, styled-components, and react-spring. The majority of the app was built by myself,
additional work also done under collaboration with my excellent colleague Pauline Feytel.<br/>

It is deployed here [https://charlotte-curran.github.io/salt-study/](https://charlotte-curran.github.io/salt-study/) using github pages.
